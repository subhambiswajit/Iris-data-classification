This repository contains a detailed preprocessing of iris dataset. The data is intentionally modified to showcase some of the preprocessing steps. such as null treatment etc.

The famous K nearest neighbour algorithm is used for classification process. We have three classes of flowers. 

- Setosa
- Virginica 
- Versicolor

Feature Scaling: Normalization using Z-Score/ Standardization
